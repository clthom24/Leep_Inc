            <p>
              Leep Audio was born from a simple frustration: it was too hard for musicians to collaborate
              across distances. Our founder, Alex, was working on a track and wanted to add live drums,
              but couldn’t find a way to easily share stems and get quality recordings back.
            </p>
            <p>
              That experience sparked the idea for a platform dedicated to musical collaboration. We started
              building in 2023 with the vision of creating a space where any musician could share their work,
              find collaborators, and create something bigger than they could alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we’re proud to serve thousands of artists worldwide, facilitating collaborations that
              span genres, continents, and creative boundaries. This is just the beginning of our journey
              to democratize music creation.
